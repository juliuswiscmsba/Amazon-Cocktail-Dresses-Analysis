MEROKEETY Women's Sleeveless Lace Floral Elegant Cocktail Dress Crew Neck Knee Length for Party,50.99,Visit the MEROKEETY Store,4.4 out of 5,"['Beautiful dress! I ordered for a wedding and I looked like a million bucks! I am 5,3, 168 lbs and a 36 D chest. I ordered bothe the L and XL. The L fit tailored and the XL gave my tummy area a little more room. Hope this helps!', 'I am highly skeptical of form fitting dresses. All the people leaving reviews seem to be skinny minis and I am far from it. I am 5\'9 and can weight anywhere between 205 to 215 depending on bloat and how I\'ve been eating.This dress is great! It fits better than I expected, has some ""give"" to it in case I am on the heavier end of my weight and is absolutely beautiful. I am not fit, toned, or even skinny fat. I am a mother of 3 that has the mom belly. You know, the one that makes you constantly look 4 months pregnant? Yeah that one. This dress fits me without being too tight. I bought an XL and while it is form fitting it doesn\'t make me look like I am busting out of sausage casing. Do not dry! It will shrink but not a ton :(  Also know that if you have junk in the trunk, when you sit down it rides up mid thigh. I thought the lace would be itchy but it isn\'t. The lining is soft but will cling if there is any static in the air. It is a kittle big in the top area as I am a C so bustier girls should be fine. Like I said, there is give so it will accommodate more blessed girls.', 'I LOVE THIS DRESS! I gained a bit of weight during quarantine and none of my nice dresses fit me anymore. After plans changed due to Covid, I had less than a week to find a dress for a small wedding we were attending. With no stores having dressing rooms open, and it being too short notice to order from my usual dress sites, I turned to amazon and crossed my fingers!And dang did amazon deliver! (pun intended üòÇ)I ordered a size large after reading many reviews and I‚Äôm really glad I did. Many people had commented that the middle section was a bit loose and I found this to be true as well. I have larger hips and a decently round booty so there was a bit of extra fabric around my lower back that I didn‚Äôt love. Luckily I know how to sew and just added two darts to that area to take it in a bit and then it was like absolute magic! The chest area fit perfectly for me, but that being said, I have a rather small chest unlike most people who tend to wear a size large. I can see how any one with a larger bust might feel a bit snug. The length of the dress was perfect for me which is usually another concern of mine. I am rather tall with a long torso (5‚Äô9), but the lace hit right at the top of the knee and the underskirt a few inches above that.I got SOOOOOO many compliments on this dress and everyone was so shocked that I had gotten it for so cheap off of amazon just two days prior! Also the color was amazing! My boyfriend was obsessed with it and decided he needs to take me to a nice dinner soon so I can wear it again üòÇIf your debating getting this dress, just do it! Read other people‚Äôs reviews that are similar in size to you rather than relying only on the size chart and you won‚Äôt be disappointed!', ""So I bought this dress for a funeral because in the pic it stops at the knee. Wellll if you factor in your 'ass-ets' if youre overly blessed like myself youre probably going to revive the dead. Too short. Definitely sexy. More for cocktails. Awesome fit. True to size. Just short on curvy women"", 'This dress is lovely. It is surely true to size. I ordered a Large which says US 10/12. It is not snug at all, and has room. Im 5\' 3"", 185lbs. The colour is navy ( Pic with flash and one without flash). Will update with another pic when I wear it out. Great Buy :). Oh, n the seller communication is good also, they were helpful in getting my order in time.Update 05/05/2017: I still LOVE it, added a pic of it worn out. I would say to others to take into account the length though... the inner lining is short ( obviously because of the lace detail)....but I was pulling down often, something to consider for curvy ladies. Hope this review helps!Another update. Nov 2 2021: 4 years later and still in perfect condition. Wore it up to last Sunday. 3rd time wearing. Updated as i came back to get another in black.', 'This dress was perfect for the award ceremony my husband had to attend. The fit was perfect and that‚Äôs typically hard for me to say being that I‚Äôm 5‚Äô11, 185lbs.', 'I am so sad. I love the design of the dress, but it‚Äôs going back.I‚Äôm 5‚Äô8 &128 athletic lbs & the small was a little snug on my lower half, but way too loose in a medium (see pics).  However the cut may not be best for somebody who is my height. The under slip is just under my butt and I would not feel comfortable wearing it to a work Christmas party as I intended - too much potential for (unintentional) flashing!  (I did NOT include the pic from the back because it was too revealing to post online, ‚Äúbutt‚Äù you get  the idea from the side view).The medium had a flaw around the neckline or I might have had it altered, so alas, it was just not meant to be! But if you do have a shorter torso and/or don‚Äôt mind flashing hiney - go for it!  It is beautiful & comfortable and I really wish it fit me better.', 'I\'d been eyeing this dress for a while and I finally ordered it for a wedding I was going to. I was impressed by how many positive reviews it had and how it seemed to flatter many different sizes and body-types.I\'m 5\'6"" and about 185; typically between a 14-16.  Pear shaped with a smaller top than bottom, which can make dress shopping hard... But this dress was perfect. I got quite a few compliments and this dress looks much more expensive than it is. It was also very comfortable.If you\'re thinking about buying this dress, just do it. I think I\'ll probably grab it in at least one more color for the nextb dressy event I end up going to!']","16,522",159
ECOWISH Womens V-Neck Spaghetti Strap Bowknot Backless Sleeveless Lace Mini Swing Skater Dress,34.99,Visit the ECOWISH Store,3.8 out of 5,"['‚ô° fair impressed now, I must say. I ordered this dress expecting it to be too big or ""baggy"" because I have a difficult time finding things to fit my smaller frame (especially in the chest department :p) Knowing this, I intended on wearing a bikini underneath during my upcoming beach vacation, so that\'s what you\'ll see in the photos.I found that the tie at the back of the neck allows for adjustment to body shape and breast size. It was easy for me to adjust and tie. There\'s extra room on the sides for a bit bustier women I\'m assuming. The lacey bit in the back made my shoulders appear feminine and alluring without being too sexy. It\'s not something I\'d wear to church, per se, but for a picnic or to the beach or a cute photo shoot, this piece is really just down right cute.I found this dress to be-well made-true to color-true to sizeWhere style is concerned, if you are hoping for something shorter like in product\'s sample pics, you might be a tiny bit disappointed as the model is likely tall/long legged. Personally, this dress is the perfect length, showing off just the right amount of leg without having to worry that a random breeze is going to display to the world the color of your pants. I think the only thing I found myself wishing for was a pocket (dresses with pockets are the bomb-diggity), so I\'ll be adding one myself! :) I enjoy this dress so much that think I\'ll buy the same one in pink.I did not receive any product or discount for my review, I just appreciate good purchases and hadn\'t seen anyone post photos of this style. Have a great day! ‚ô°', 'I‚Äôm an American size 12 height 5‚Äô10. ordered an Xl to compensate for my height.  I love the dress', 'Fit as expected, wears like a dream!

Hope this review is helpful.', 'The last thing I need is more dresses but I *had* to try this and I love it.It‚Äôs adorable. I love that the straps and tie around the back/underbust are adjustable so you can really make it work for you. It‚Äôs also enough coverage for fuller cup sizes (I‚Äôm 34D) but I imagine that might be a con for smaller busts. I also love that it‚Äôs short enough that it doesn‚Äôt end up making me (5‚Äô2‚Äù) look shorter.I haven‚Äôt washed it, but I‚Äôm unsure if it is a material that will hold up to being washed, but we shall see. In other words, this was the last thing I needed but it‚Äôs so adorable it‚Äôs going to be my favorite dress of the summer!.... also, I had trouble adjusting my info for people figuring out fit so I‚Äôm 5‚Äô2‚Äù, 125 lbs, 34 D, and the small fit perfect', ""This dress is sooo sexy, I already ordered the burgundy, now i'm going to get the black one as well. You won't be disappointed and I got the dress quickly"", 'I bought this dress for my graduation, and it came in today. I absolutely love it. I saw a lot of bad reviews so I was a bit nervous but overall it feels like nice quality for the price and it fits amazing. I love the bow detail in the back. I think it‚Äôs extremely flattering. I wear a C cup and the top is a tad low for school but this dress looks like the front could be pinned easily without notice. I also love how the dress comes up on the sides of my chest, it is very supportive and it is double lined so I don‚Äôt have to wear a bra. Overall, I would recommend this dress to someone for an event like this!', '\xa0It‚Äôs a perfect summer dress! Love the style and material is lightweight.  Easy to put on and very comfortable.  True to size.  I got small and it fits perfectly.', 'Really cute dress but I unnecessarily ordered a size too big because other reviews said to do! I would actually recommend staying true to size. With the large, I had to tie the straps in the back into knots and it was loose and hanging on my back. I‚Äôm 5‚Äô6 and around 150 pounds and I should‚Äôve gotten the medium, as I usually do. Other than that, it was pretty cute! A bit revealing, but very nice. Also, it was a bit odd how the slip underneath stops about an inch before the dress does, but it wasn‚Äôt that big of a deal. Overall, this was a great dress, but I‚Äôll have return because I choose the wrong size.']","17,009",147

I might have opted to hem it a few inches shorter since I am shorter than average, but I did not have time. Otherwise the color and fit were perfect and the top was pretty and flattering.

The length comes to about my knees. I am not that well endowed, size 34 or 36/B, so I do like that you can tighten or loosen the back to fit your frame, within reason of course. The belt is detachable and would also work nicely as a hair piece...and there is also a side zipper for easier dressing. I bought a navy blue petticoat with it and the length on it with the dress is also perfect. However, I debated between the navy blue, (which I purchased) and the white, I almost wish I'd of gone with the white because the navy is a tad lighter then the dress, but nothing to where anyone would notice, other then myself. Its barely noticeable, so I will be keeping the navy petticoat.All-in-all, I am VERY pleased and excited to wear this get-up this spring to my EMS picnic, for EMS week!

It also helps bring out your curves. Plus the halter helps with altering how high or low you would like it.The only down side is the piece around the waist to create the bow.

The fabric matched the image of the white floral pattern. The tie around the waist is just that, a long piece of fabric. It‚Äôs best to know how to tie a cute bow for this dress, the fabric was long enough to go around my waist and tie a decent bow. The neck line sits higher than I‚Äôm use to but it‚Äôs more appropriate than what I was expecting, which is great for the crowd I will be in. Because I ordered one size up, the middle around the waist was considerably bigger than needed; but the lace up back helped synch in to fit great. I added a petticoat (white) underneath for a slightly more full effect. Without it, the dress does lay somewhat flat (my hips do flare it out a bit without the petticoat).

I wore it to a friend\'s wedding and got so many compliments! It fits as expected per the size chart, but since the back is ruched elastic with a corset-type tie, you can adjust this to your liking. I had to cinch it pretty tight to keep it from sliding down my back (maybe some fabric tape would help). That said, I would NOT size down as then it wouldn\'t fit in the waist. This dress offers great coverage in the back despite being a halter (I am weary of halter tops as they seem to have absurdly low backs, but not this one!).

The waist band is not at all stretchy or forgiving.The 22 is a tad too big for me, but that\'s an easy fix; just tie the bow tighter!ARMS:I also have JUICY arms and was worried about the sleeves, but the lace is suuuuuper stretchy. It fits over my arms nicely, but it\'s not too tight and I don\'t feel like I\'m in danger of ripping anything.BUSTI\'m a 42C. I tried the dress on while wearing a basic sports bra and had a bit of room in the bust of the dress, but if I wear a bra with structure or a push-up, the bust is going to be fantastic!LENGTH:It hits just below my knees (but it\'s not too long. I hate tea-length and midi-length. This is nowhere close to that.)WEIRD PART:The tie around the waist...It\'s not, like, one long ribbon fed through loops (ie: the position of the ribbon is not adjustable). It\'s two pieces sewn on either side of the dress. Thankfully, the waistband hits me in the most flattering spot, but some people may be disappointed to find they can\'t move the ribbon. Also, the ribbons are not long enough to tie around your body (ie: if I tied them back, criss crossed, then brought them to the front, I\'d just have enough to make a knot. You\'re stuck either tying the ribbons back and making a bow on your back, or bringing both pieces forward if you want a full bow in the front as pictured.)BONUS THAT PROBABLY ONLY I CARE ABOUT:I bought this dress (in blue!) for graduation. (Finding a dress for a master\'s graduation in December for a grown adult woman was... challenging.) The dress is completely hidden under my gown (both at the top and at the bottom/hem) and when my gown is unzipped, the blue pops so beautifully! The nipped-in waist of the dress adds shape and I think it\'s going to make for some really cute unzipped gown pics! Also, the tone of the blue in this dress compliments the tones of the blues in my tassle and hood, and it\'s a nearly exact match for the dark blue portions.I\'m really excited to wear this dress. It makes me feel really pretty, and, as vain as it sounds, I know it\'s going to look GREAT in photos!', 'This dress is perfect!

The shoulder stays in place, and doesn't require tugging and adjusting.. For reference, I wear a 42DDD bra, waist size is 38, and hips are 53, I usually fit a 2x comfortably, and sometimes a 3x, depending on the size chart of the item. I would like this dress in other colors as well.""]","7,576",190

I am a obese/petite lady and it is hard to find dress that hit at the right length. I couldn't be happier. So comfy."", 'I‚Äôve been in search for a dress to wear to a wedding and have been striking out left and right.  I‚Äôve gained a lot of weight lately due to health issues and have been struggling with how to dress my current body.  I‚Äôm 5 ft, 210 lbs, and a 38H, so not the easiest size and shape to fit.  This dress feels so flattering on me and is extremely comfortable.  The pattern and banding on the lace helps break up my top and the bottom flows nicely to conceal what you want to from your natural waist.  The fabric has a bit of stretch to it and everything seems very well made.  This dress is a great find!', 'Love the color, the fit is great, I love how it fits on the waist. The length is perfect too. I seem to find too many that are too short. Great quality as well!', 'This dress is absolutely gorgeous and fits true to size. Definitely a winner!', 'This was the perfect dress to wear to my courthouse wedding. I knew I didn‚Äôt want a formal gown but also knew I wanted to dress up a little bit. The dress fit perfectly for me which means just a little loose so I felt very comfortable while also feeling beautiful and classy. I could have done a small but I don‚Äôt like it to fit that tight so I returned the small & kept the medium. It is a little see through, you can see dark/colored underwear. You might be able to get away without a slip if you wear nude or white under garments. I chose to wear a slip & nude undergarments because I didn‚Äôt want to worry about how I looked. I gained about 5 pounds recently and the dress was very forgiving. I still felt like I looked great. Loved it. For size reference I‚Äôm 5‚Äô8‚Äù, weighed 159, waist 29 inches & 34B bra size.', 'I have a condition called lipedema that affects both my legs and my arms, making them larger than normal and a bit oddly shaped. (Lipedema is often overlooked by doctors, so, if you have large legs that do not seem to be helped by diet or exercise, you may want to check it look it up and then talk to your doctor.) On top of that, I am 5\' tall with slightly shorter than average legs and arms, even for my height. (I have a 25"" inseam.) I wear a 34DD/DDD. My waist is 31"", high hip is 41, hip including my butt is 52"", and my legs are big. I typically wear a size 14 or 16 bottom and a medium or large top depending on the arms and chest. It is like you took a slightly chubby, almost hourglassed shaped woman who was 5\'11"" and smashed her down 11"" and shortened her limbs. I hate my body and I hate buying clothes.However, my husband and I have a family wedding coming up and he is wearing a tux.  I needed something that made me not want to cry or hide, and something that was dressy enough not to look out of place. I came across this dress and took a chance. I was going to get an XXL, but, after reading the reviews, I went with the XL. It fits wonderfully. If my legs and hips were a little smaller, I could have gotten a large with the amount of stretch in the material. If I do not look at my legs, I love it. My husband and daughter think it looks great on me. I would normally wear either a higher or lower neckline than what it has, but I really cannot complain.The fabric is so much softer than I expected, and it drapes beautifully. I almost feel pretty in it. The lining, which is probably raised by the size of my legs, hits at just above my knee, while the outer, lace layer hits a couple of inches below the knee, which, for me, is just about mid calf. Because of the difference between my bust, waist, and hips, the waist does not lay as I would expect it to on someone else, but it is not bad at all.I shan\'t be posting any pictures, but I do hope that the measurements help someone.', 'Nice, brilliant white dress. The fabric is a nice, substantial weight, especially for the price! I usually wear a size 16 dress as and the XL fit very well. The dress has a good bit of stretch to it. I\'m about 5\'3"" and it hit right around my knees without heels on. You\'ll definitely need nude colored under garments as white is notoriously see through!', 'When I saw this dress I thought the picture was too good to be true. The dress is stunning and extremely flattering. The waist is higher than I expected, but it didn\'t affect the overall length of the dress. I\'m 5\'9"" and the waist fell a few inches below the bottom the bust. The color is a little brighter than I thought it would be, I was expecting a muted lavender, but it was more of a bright purple with some pink tones. The nude color underneath help tone down the brightness though. Overall I would definitely recommend the dress for the price! It\'s inexpensive without compromising the integrity of the product.']","3,217",94

I'm a 34DD and wear mostly mediums and the large fits very nicely. I feel like it's made well. The neckline is a bit higher than I expected but that just makes it more appropriate for the period you're aiming for. It also arrived in a few days with the 2 day Prime shipping.

Love the cut and fabric is a nice weight and pattern.', ""Before I review anything I like to wait to see how the item holds up. According to my order history, I purchased this dress on June 2nd and it arrived on June 14th. I don't remember why it took so long to receive. I didn't need it right away and didn't have a specific event in mind, but it was a lightning deal. At the time the dress was $26.99 and the deal took $7.00 off. I'm a relatively frugal (read cheap a$$) shopper and I figured for the price and the return policy available, I couldn't go wrong. By the time I received it, I had forgotten I ordered it but was very excited when I realized what it was. It was packaged in a plastic bag and was neatly folded. I used a garment steamer to get the creases out of it and tried it on.I'm 5' short/tall and about 135 lbs and fairly curvy. The dress is medium and is pretty fitted on me so if you prefer a more relaxed look you may want to order a larger size. Overall I would say the fit is true to size. The material is not uncomfortably thick and not thin. I would say the material is sturdy and hold its shape really well so the skirt has a full look to it, just like the image shown. The elasticity makes it very comfortable to wear even with it being fitted. I  loved the length, which is rare for me because I generally need to hem my dresses.I decided to wear it to the morning-after wedding breakfast of my son and daughter-in-law. We live on opposite coasts so the dress had been packed in a suitcase. I used a travel steamer and was able to easily get the ceases out. The style of the dress and the fabric pattern has a 50's vibe to it so I chose to wear it with black patent leather pumps, but this dress would be adorable with black flats too. This dress is super versatile and can be paired with various accessories to fit the occasion.I have noticed the price has gone up to $29.99 and while my cheap self wouldn't have ordered it before, now that I know how well made it is, I would definitely have purchased it. If I wasn't so cheap, I'd most likely purchase it in another pattern. If you're undecided I recommend making the purchase. It's flattering, comfortable, and well made so it should last several seasons. I feel like I got an awesome deal with this dress and am thrilled with my purchase!"", ""This dress is exactly what I hoped it would be...bright, cheerful, and springy! The material is sturdy, and the skirt looks fine with or without an under-crinoline. The length is right at my knee. The 2X fit well. My only adjustment will be to the shoulders (too generous) but I always have this issue so I don't blame the dress. In fact, pulling the shoulder material up made the dress even more flattering in the waistline. I'm pairing it with a white lace shrug. Very happy with this purchase."", ""I was a little worried because I would have preferred to purchase this in at least a 3X, but the 2X is all that was available in the pattern I wanted and thankfully it fits me just fine.  It is a little snug on my chest but it is for an event so I can live with that.  In inches, my measurements are 50-40-50.  But it is a beautiful dress! I recommend buying petticoats/crinoline to go underneath.  I am going to wear two to get the look and effect that I want. But, that's just my preference, you can absolutely wear the dress without them.""]","4,106",53
50s Dress Women Vintage Cocktail Halter Dress 1950s Rockabilly Party Dress,32.99,DRESSTELLS,4.4 out of 5,"[""Ok ladies,Here are some pointers for this dress:1) the dress is indeed a very thin silk material but I can wear my black lacey bra and it will not show. This material is pretty resilient so don't worry about tearing. However, I am going to hand wash this lovely dress because of how fragile the material feels.2) This dress is remarkably COMFORTABLE!! Even though is felt kinda tight (I am 5ft 4in, 42 DD, round tummy, 225 pounds, and the tightest it was landed in the breast area and highest on my waist. I ordered a 2x and the 3x will definitely be too big. I'm just busty cursed which is why this dress felt tight.) This dress was definitely not uncomfortably tight. When I first put it on, I was SUPER afraid it would tear because it feels so thin and dainty but they used some nice silk making this dress because after you sit down, you definitely realize that this is NOT a problem at all in this dress.3) How to put it on: this is going to sound silly but lace the back as loose as possible, then don't unzip it. Put it on over your head braless. Once it's around your waist, put your bra on, and then pull the dress up over your breasts. Then, to take it off, simply unzip. It's quick, easy, and effortless. I can put this dress on in less then a minute even with it feeling tight.So that's all I have ladies.

The polka dot dress is sturdy, solid material with a little stretch to it. I measure 94x74x104, 34D, so according to the size chart I am (barely) a size medium. I had to exchange for a small, since the medium felt a bit big. The elastic panel bunched up & stuck out in the back. The small fit like a stretchy,  comfy, beautifullllll glove! No bra needed, since material is so sturdy! :-) I ordered a 2nd dress in the cherry style size small, assuming it would be the same as the polka dot dress. It is beautiful, but disappointed its not the same quality material as the polka dot dress. It has a stretchy back panel, but the rest of the dress is not stretchy & the seams feel like they will rip. It is silky & clingy & feels like a nightgown.

Very flattering for my body. I wish the sizing was for extensive. I'm a size 22-26 depending on style. I bought a 3x. I could not use the zipper (left side under arm) in fear of catching myself in it. Plus, I couldn't pull the material together because of having a bigger body and the awkward location of the zipper. My hips are too much for this dress to be pulled up, so my only option was overhead. Pulled it down until the seam under the bust of the dress met my own bust. I'm also large chested, 2D-3D depending on style. So I had to literally do the old boob scoop, one at a time, to finish pulling this dress down. Once situated (make sure you pull it on straight because there's no turning it once it's on) it was gorgeous. Now mind you, I always wear petticoats with these because they give this style dress such a beautiful look. Not a true 3x in my opinion (I wear 3x tees) but I made it manage."", ""I ordered the 3x. I am 5'7 and a 22/24 depending on the cut and brand. I am also on the smaller chested side wearing a 42b. When I ordered the dress I looked through the reviews to sort of figure out what size to buy. I got it on prime so it was here in 2 days. It fits snug where I feel it should and hides my problem areas very well while actually giving me curves and a very retro feminine look. I wore the dress out to karaoke night at my local bar and just about every woman there complimented the dress. I did buy a petticoat to wear under the dress as well as a strapless/backless bra. I love this dress and will definitely be buying more of this style in the future because it makes me feel very pretty and that's a very hard thing to do being a girl of my size and body shape.

Pair it with a cute sincher belt or a skinny belt if you need one.I made sure to read all the comments and see if there was any sizing issues that other people may have had so I knew what too be aware of when ordering.I measured myself and compared it to the chart. The chart was fairly accurate in comparison to how the dress fit once I got it and tried it on. It fit perfectly in the chest but the waist was a rather loose on me. I purposely bought a size up (even though in average I normally fit a Large or X-Large) because I would rather have room in the dress and take it in myself if I had to.If you order this dress MEASURE YOURSELF FIRST.

Very flattering! It seems to be larger than normal bcuz I am usually a large, but like I said, I kept the medium. I posted two pics: the first one shows there is a flap of fabric that keeps showing above my chest. I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs a flaw in the dress though, I believe it is bcuz I have a large chest.

It\'s a little bit loose on top, but that\'s life as a pear shape for you (a size L might have worked, but then I wasn\'t sure the bottom half would fit, so I decided to stick with the XL). I must say the dress makes your rear end look fabulous, especially when you add heels to the equation.I\'m very pleased with what I got for the price. There are some weird fabric flaps inside the dress at the neckline and arm holes, but double-sided fabric tape works nicely to keep them in place.

I wanted a dress to wear for nursing school graduation and wanted it to fit right. 39"" bust, 30"" waist, and 40.5"" hips put me at a large (5\'8"", 160ish pounds, and pretty athletic). I wanted it form fitting, so I went with a medium. I was so loose, it had way too much extra material at the waist and looked really weird. The booty was fitted, so I don\'t know if a small would be too small. Also, the material is folded over at the top (where other people have shown the extra material creeping out), but you could see the delineation of the doubled fabric. I really wanted to like this dress, the yellow was exactly what I wanted and it looked amazing on all the other buyers. Unfortunately, the sizing was way off and the fit was terribly wrong.', 'This dress looks like the pictures. Œ§he stitching is impeccable and it fits very nicely.

GownTown Womens 1950s Cape Collar Vintage Swing Stretchy Dresses,39.99,Visit the GownTown Store,4.6 out of 5,"['This dress is amazing!', ""This dress is wonderful! The fit is spot on and the fabric is heavy with a good amount of stretch, so the bodice hugs rather than clinging. At 5'9, the skirt just covers my knees. The construction is unexpectedly good for a dress of this price, and more importantly the skirt is a full circle-- there was no skimping on fabric. The sleeves and skirt are neatly hemmed with a coverstitch machine, interior seams and facing edges are served, and there are no wrinkles around the zipper. As a seamstress I usually make my own clothes since I am so picky about fit, construction, and proportion, but this dress is absolutely wonderful and I will certainly be purchasing from GownTown again in the future."", 'I am 5\'7"" tall, with the following measurements: Bust 44, Waist 36, Hips 41, and I ordered the XL.  I am 51 and have had a child (some minor stretch marks on stomach/breast) and I am not as firm and perky overall as I was in my 20\'s and 30\'s (or as their models always are---sure if your are 22 this will look great no matter what, lol)  .  I have purchased several 1950\'s ""vintage"" style dresses from Amazon, and better quality dressmakers such as Unique Vintage, and this dress fits me better than all of them combined!! Why?Most dress makers do not increase the bust length as the sizes go up, nor do they make the front a little longer or do a full bust adjustment to accommodate the fabric breasts need to fill out  the bust area while still maintaining an even waist height waistband.  This dress nailed it on me.  My ""upper breast"" measurement (directly under my armpits and above my breasts) measures 39"", while my bust (the fullest part of my chest, lower than my upper bust) is 44"" in circumference.  This difference of 5"" is usually not accounted for when Amazon dressmakers are making larger size dresses, and results in a bunch of flapping fabric between the arm hole, shoulder and the bust.  Not in this dress ladies.  Measure your upper bust and if it\'s close to mine, this dress will fit you amazing (it could have been a little tighter on me, like an 1"", to fit me even better, but  it\'s not enough to make it look ill-fitting, so if you are an 1"" to 1.5"" larger in your upper bust, this should still fit well).  The waist on this dress hits me about 1/2"" above my belly button which my belly button sits at my true waist.  Every single retro dress I have purchased has the waist sitting right below my boobs and I look thick and like I am wearing my little sister\'s dress--EEK!.  NOT THIS ONE!!!!!! : DAlso, I have muscular arms, and carry a bit of fat on my bicep (really, fat sits like a bicycle tire around my boobs and arms in the same location...uggggh!), and the sleeves on this dress cover that and the bottom cuff of the sleeve sits about 2"" above my elbow, which is the best spot for me to make my arms look thinner.  The fabric is VERY stretchy and light weight which has it\'s pros and cons.Pros: It gives a lot, and it makes it easy to move in, especially in the arms and if this is a problem area for you typically, it should be OK.  It\'s breathable and flowy and It\'s tea-length on me, hitting me below the knee at the height of my calves.Cons:  It does not have enough weight to hang quite right with a triple layer crinoline slip, though it lays fine on it\'s own.  And I do wish the sleeves had a little breathing room, and were not so form fitting, but again, they are not restrictive.  Also the neckline is too low on me, and that is not how dresses were in the 1950\'s.  For a woman my age to show this much cleavage would have been scandal.  So I will sew in a modesty cloth.  On Youtube, a great seamstress named Liz Von Villas will show you how, and it\'s adorable.  She also has a video that explains, in depth, how to measure for a ""Full Bust Adjustment"" if you ever want to sew your own dress, or have a seamstress make you one, or it\'s good to understand if you are ordering a semi-custom dress where the maker can customize it to fit your body.  It\'s been eye-opening, and I now understand exactly why off the rack clothing rarely fits my upper body right.The pictures are straight out of the shipping package, and I do think this dress would benefit from an ironing, especially the collar, because it\'s wrinkly and stands up a bit much.  But no biggie.  If the ironing doesn\'t fix it a couple of concealed stitches would.  All in all, I am pleasantly surprised, and very happy.  I hope this helps larger chested women make a smart purchase.  I hate when people go on on about how great or ill-fitting a dress is, and never give their measurements and the size they purchases (not all postings show the size automatically), it\'s like they are venting just to vent; geezzzzz, help a sista out!By the way, I studied the cut of these dresses very closely in the pictures, and it appeared to me that this one had a longer bodice than some of the other colors/styles.  So I can only account for the light blue and navy plaid with the light blue shawl collar.  It\'s a beautiful color and black, navy, light blue or gray accessories would look lovely with it.  Also white, because it has beautiful pearlized white buttons going down the front that really give it a pop.  Yay! to Gowntown for this one, I only hope they make more with long bodices for us busty girls.  Thanks Gowntown!', '\xa0We purchased this dress to go with a ""jitterbug"" theme for piano ensemble but knew that this feminine dress would be perfect for all church-dressy occasions.

This is a style of dress that works for any dressy occasion and with the length and petticoats will be perfect for playing piano or going swing dancing with friends.  Importantly, it is a modest dress with no mesh top or back and a below-the-knee length.  We have had so much trouble finding pre-made dresses that are modest.We will be ordering more thanks to the variety of styles and colors offered for each of our daughters.  The price point makes this possible for us to do this.It arrived when promised in great condition.', ""Bought the black with white collar, 3/4 length sleeves. I LOVE this dress! I had to get the XL to fit my bust; the large was too snug and material pulled. The XL felt much better, but a touch loose in waist. The material is polyester & spandex so it's an unusual material mix for me, but the weight of material is good and it really looks great, especially with a petticoat! I had tried on many expensive department store dresses for my company Christmas party and nothing worked, until I found this one. This dress was perfect! I felt beautiful and the price was really great! I honestly loved it so much I ordered the red/black one too. Which by the way is not a cherry apple red, it's a bit more burgundy/wine red, but it's really pretty.BUT WARNING: Color is not 100% colorfast. The white collar WILL TURN GREY!I saw online that it could be dry-cleaned so I thought that would solve the issue. My dry cleaner refused to touch it since it did not have a care label inside. So I handwashed in a tub, keeping the white collar out of the water. The water turned very black. I did this twice, then I tried to soak it in a mix of cold water & white vinegar (vinegar will set the color in yarn & prevent colors running so I tried it). Then I rinsed in cold water (still did not have the white collar in the water) and the water ran clear so I thought all was good. Put the whole dress in a hand wash and apparently there was still enough running black dye that it turned the collar a dingy grey. So SAD! But I love this dress so much I'm going to try again. Called Amazon and they said they would replace it. I'll just have to figure out how to launder this without getting the collar in the same water as the dress. This would be so much better if the collar actually detached for laundering. I took off one star for the collar/color run issues."", 'Got so many compliments wearing this.

I have a bit of a stomach and curvy. The fringe on the dress hits below my knees,  the bottom of the dress hits above my knees, and the liner is about an inch above that.Pros: this dress looks exactly like pictured. The details are beautiful, the bead work and sequins are lovely. It\'s a great flapper era dress without looking costume-y and cheap.The design goes all the way around the dress. It has sleeves for those that like to cinch things in and wear a bra, and it\'s flattering which is hard to do for a flapper era style dress. The bead work doesn\'t call attention to your problem areas and the dark color helps hide bumps.Cons: it\'s a heavy dress. The beading weighs it down.

I was skeptical about what size to get so being safe I went with a xxxl. I read several other reviews about it being too small. I‚Äôm big busted so for the sake of ‚Äúthe girls‚Äù, I went up some sizes. Normally I‚Äôm an xl, size 18 (almost 16). So you know where this dress fell on me, I‚Äôm 5‚Äô2‚Äù, which is why it came mid calf on me. I will post photos too. I also bought a Grace Karin petticoat to give it a little flare. I decided to take a chance and wash this dress in the washer even though it says dry clean. I air dried it and it came out fine. I did put it in a washer bag before washing it. I will be ordering more dresses soon!  My birthday is in 10 days!!!!!!', 'This is a pretty cute dress.  I got lots of compliments.  The fabric doesnt have a whole lot of give to it, but it does have a tiny bit.  Just be certain to follow the size chart.  I went by my bust size, which is 40 inches, and it fit pretty good. It looks much cuter with a black peticoat than by itself.  It is machine washable, and the colors stay true in the cool cycle.The only thing I would change would be to add a side-zip instead of a back zip.', 'I don\'t feel like a see a lot of reviews from taller people, so here is one. I am 5\'10 and change, about 200lbs, and wear a size 14 comfortably, but could go down a half size easy if it existed, and I wer a 38C. I went off the sizing chart that is provided and got a 3XL. The fabric is nicer than I thought it was going to be. It has a decent weight to it and is not see through. The seams are nicely put together too and the zipper runs smoothly, but there is not top clasp if that is something that you like. The length is nice and hits just above my knees, I think a perfec length for a dress like this. I do have a little extra room in the waist of the dress and it is a little stretchy ( I can even put it on without unzipping it if needed). It does come with a belt of the same pattern and tapered ends like a giant ribbon. In the pictures I have a different belt on. The chest of the dress is pretty roomy for me and could accomidate someone with more boob than I have easily. I am fairly broad shouldered and one of my problems usually is constricted movement and I did not have a problem in this dress. It would look good with a krynolyn underskirt for the classic poof. I got this as a wedding attendee option and decided not to go with it only due to me peronally not liking how the top half fit. It is a gorgeous dress for anyone who wants to rock checkers ( one of my favorite patteres). I have also included a photo of the squares next to a ruller for those of you who are curious about the size of them, about 1"" tall. I would consider looking at these dresses again in the future.

PrettyGuide Women's 1920s Dress Sequin Art Deco Flapper Dress with Sleeve,57.99,Visit the PrettyGuide Store,4.5 out of 5,"['I purchased this dress in a size 14/16. It fit fine, a little on the loose side and a little stretchy but I loved it and got several compliments.', 'I had a work Gala to attend and did not want to spend a lot on something that i probably would not wear again. I am 5\'6"" and wear a size 14-16 usually.  In choosing a dress I literally ordered 18 to see if I could get one that would fit and look good. I felt that this one was the most flattering.Some concerns that I had when ordering was length, wearability, comfort, and style.  Length- this had the underdress or sheath that went to about 3 or 4 inches above my knee and the fringe ended about 1 inch below my knees.  Wearability- The material is stretchy and I was able to put it on by slipping it over my head. There was a side zipper but I find that they are difficult to zip up so I skipped using it. The beading was in appropriate places and not scratchy on exposed areas of skin. It was also long enough to sit in (some of the others were impossible to sit in without risking a crotch shot.) It also stood up to a 5 hour affair without unravelling or losing most of its beading as I had this happen on another dress.  Comfort- As I previously stated the fabric was stretchy so I did not feel like I was too confined or at rick of splitting a seam. I could also sit in it.  Style- I felt that this was a very flattering style. I liked the sleeves as it was a November event with temperatures in the low 40\'s F. I also liked the placement of the beading/embellishment. I thought that it emphasized the waist without needing a corset to wear it. I defiantly did not feel that this was a ""plus"" size garment. I sis not have to be a size 4 to look good. It emphasized all of the right areas.  I would recommend this item not only for a 20\'s themed party but for any dressy event.', ""This dress was very classy.  I am a musician and had to perform at a large Roaring 20's event.  I just had a baby and it was hard to find a flapper dress that covered my arms a little better and wasn't extremely form fitting.  This made me perform very confidently.  Great find!"", ""This review is for the PrettyGuide  1920‚Äôs Art Deco Sequined Flapper Dress in Gold Burgundy. I bought two of this same dress, one in my actual size: MEDIUM, 8-10, and one a size up: LARGE, 12-14, and will address sizing a little later. I will start by saying that in my experience the dress runs true to size, but if you prefer a looser fit,  you can probably go up one size and still be fine.Quality: for the price, I was pleasantly surprised. I found a loose thread or two, easily trimmed, but no hanging or missing beading, and no unraveling seams or botched stitching.  On one dress, a few of the hem tassels were overly long, but again this was an easy fix.  The side zipper is a bit touchy, but if you are gentle with it, it should not be a problem.  Although the garment needs to be handled with care, due to all the lattice-netting, beads, and bling, it feels solid rather than fragile.  The burgundy color with the black accents and gold trimmings is simply stunning in person. The effect is rich and elegant.  DO wash this dress before wearing; out of the package it has a slightly ‚Äúchemical‚Äù feel to it that I associate with fabric dye that will bleed easily until a first wash and rinse.  Carefully turn it inside out and HAND WASH ONLY, preferably in a bathtub so you can let the dress stretch out; having to crunch it up could damage the beading.  I let the dress flat dry, still inside out, on a thick bath towel for about 30 minutes before hanging it to finish drying.Sizing: At 5‚Äô5‚Äù and 130 lbs, I am a solid 8 in skirts and pants, but a 10 in dresses due to broad shoulders.  The medium, 8-10, fits perfectly.  It is flatteringly form fitting without being uncomfortably snug. The beaded overlay helps disguise any minor rolls (I‚Äôm an active person, and in fairly good shape, but I‚Äôll freely admit I‚Äôm not as svelte as I was 20 years ago, lol).  I prefer a freer fit with clothing in general, but I really like how this dress both looks and feels.  The hem of the solid under-dress comes just to my knees, short enough to be saucy but not so short I have to restrict my movement to stay decent in polite company.  Overall I am quite happy with this dress.However, for a true 1920‚Äôs flapper effect, it actually fits a bit TOO perfectly.  To satisfy burning curiosity, I went ahead and ordered the large, 12-14, figuring I could send it back if it hung like a sack, and rather expecting it would.  Another pleasant surprise: the next size up did NOT hang like a sack.  The looser fit allows the dress to hang in more of a flapper-style straight line, but it is still lovely and flattering, with the waist, neckline, and shoulders still falling where they should.  The solid hemline comes to just below my knees, so I gained about an inch of length, but still short enough to be saucy.  I've seen dresses before with styling of a quality that allows sizing to be flexible but still well fitting, and this is one of them.Bottom line:  if you have generous curves, or like your dresses to have some extra room, you should be able to size up and still have an attractive, comfortable fit.  I would say this dress runs true to an average size, so it really comes down to personal preference.  For myself, I will be keeping both dresses.  The larger will do duty as a costume/party dress, while the ‚Äútrue size‚Äù will be reserved for holidays and formal events.  With contemporary shoes and accessories, this dress can easily step from the early 20th century into the early 21st century.  I am hoping by dividing wear between the two, I can extend the useful life of both.  Yes, I LOVE this dress THAT much!"", 'Absolutely beautiful dress. The liner is stitched to the sides so it won\'t ride up. Front and back are identical and no tags, so not sure which was front but didn\'t matter. Forgiving size wise and the underneath is stretchy. The dress is pretty heavy with all of the beading but wore on 90 degree evening and it wasn\'t bad. Sleeves are nice esp if you\'re not thrilled with showing off your arms. The dress held together great. Easy to sit in and didn\'t ride up or show your behind if you bent over, which was nice. I\'m not incredibly tall though 5\'-6"" and short waisted (have long 32"" legs) so that helps. Purchased the 3X and normally wear a size 20 or 2-3X tops. Have practically no waist (49/45/49) but it was pretty forgiving. Wish they had more color options for us heavier gals, but the royal blue w/ black is beautiful. Wore a peacock headband w/ black beads and black pumps. Tried other color shoes, but really need to be black w/ this dress.', 'Very comfortable and well made for the price.  Had it altered to fit better in the waist.', 'I\'m 5\'3, 135 pounds and have a ""mummy tummy"".  I ordered a 12/14 even though one or even two sizes smaller would have fit me. I intentionally ordered it large because I don\'t care for form fitting clothes (because of previously mentioned tummy), and because I was going for an authentic 1920s look for a Gatsby party. Women did not wear form fitting dresses in the 20s.It is a beautiful dress. Seems to be well made and excellent quality. One of the pieces of fringe was quite a bit longer than the rest- but that\'s to be expected on any article of clothing that has fringe. I just clipped it and moved on.Here\'s a tip- if you order this dress, or any dress with tassels or fringe, *go without pantyhose or tights*. Or if you must wear them, choose thigh highs.  It is so difficult readjusting the dress after going to the restroom. I think it would have been MUCH easier if I hadn\'t been wearing pantyhose.']","6,777",152

It\'s fun to play with fashion and have pueces representative of different decades.I have a hard time buying clothes online. I\'m pretty much a potato on legs, with big boobs, and it\'s difficult to find things that truly flatter my body. When I saw this adorable dress, I scoured the reviews to find ones from people who seem to have a similar body type. I almost ordered an XL because that\'s the largest size I wear in stores like Old Navy and Target. I range anywhere from a medium to an extra large in most stores depending on item type and the fabric.For reference - I am 5\'3"" tall. I weigh 195 pounds and my bust is 38DDD. Most of my weight is distrubuted in my torso...like a pregnant person.This dress is absolutely delightful. It can be scary ordering online because you can\'t see or feel the fabric quality. This fabric is good quality and it is not see through in the color I ordered (Army Green). I chose the option with the heart buttons. The color - Army Green - is vibrant and would actually be a perfect Christmas green. I can see making this a bit festive in the holiday season with some red shoes or a red purse or even a red crinoline. The belt is not attached, so you have the option of leaving it off or on.The fit was perfect, which is saying something for my body type. I would love to buy more of these. My biggest worry was the bust. Often, clothes can fit me perfectly everywhere else, but the bust. Buttons are especially tricky for those of us who carry extra luggage on our chest. I was so happy when I tried this on and saw that the buttons actually fit! No pulling. No gaping.My only issue - and this is personal preference - is the length. At 5\'3"" many of my dresses hit a bit lower than I\'d like. This one hits about two inches below my knee. I prefer to just skim the top of the knee as that is just more flattering on me personally. I want to see how it looks with a crinoline as that may adjust where the length hits. Otherwise, it\'ll need to be hemmed. This dress isn\'t floofy. Take note of the photos others have left. If you want to add fullness to the skirt, you\'ll need to wear a crinoline, which you can find on Amazon or in some brick and mortar stores.I\'m super happy with this dress. It\'s adorable, it fits very well, and it fulfills my desire for 1950\'s fashion styles.', 'I needed a dress for a costume (Alice in Wonderland - I\'m Alice) but wanted something that I would wear again. I came across this dress, along with a few others, but this was by far my favorite. I like the quality, although the zipper was a little sticky and I wish it had a little hook at the top of the zipper to help me zip up. However, this is an easy fix to do on my own. I am 5\'8"", 205lbs  with a 36/38 D chest and I ordered the XL which JUST FIT. It\'s not too tight, but would not fit if it was any tighter. It hits right above the knee. I think the sleeves are really cute and I love the heart button detail (which won\'t show for my costume, but will look so cute when I wear it normally). I think this dress will look great with a petticoat. Hope this review helps :)']","6,336",85

I wore this dress to a wedding and it was absolutely gorgeous.  I received so much compliments I felt like I was the bride. Also very true to size!!!!!', ""So I had to order this dress twice. The first time it came from China and although it took a while to reach, it did get to me sooner than expected. It was in regular plastic wrapping. When I got it it didn't fit (I'm busty) so I had to return it. I had to return it to California (shipping was like $14) but outside of the shipping cost- the return process was super easy. The company is very responsive and I got my money back very quickly. They also sent a follow up email which was nice.  I ordered a size up which was the largest they had and hoped for the best. They must've had it in stock in the states because I scored free shipping and it got to me quickly.  This time is was in much nicer packaging with their name on it.  I didn't think the dress was extra stretchy as some described, again I blame the 'girls'. I'm 5'9 and normally wear a 16-18 depending on the brand and material. The dress itself did have nice beading and was heavy for a $50 dress but not heavy like a $200 dress if that makes sense. The sheer part was fine because there's a double layer of sheer that goes mid thigh so my butt wouldn't be exposed if I bent over as some described. The only two negatives I would say is that I wish the sweetheart line wasn't cut so high (to be more vampy) and the zipper was very delicate for my boyfriends clumsy fat fingers- I was scared he was going to break it. Also there's no hook at the top but once it was zipped up it, it was secure. These were very minor considering the price.  I received MANY compliments at the wedding we attended and it's safe to say we were considered best dressed. All in all it was very worth it.

The other nice feature of this 1920s inspired dress is that I can wear it to a normal black tie event or to a dressy function in place of a black cocktail dress and not feel like I\'m in a ""costume"".

You can see bralines so I suggest wearing shapewear or a low-profile bra: this may be alleviated with a darker color dress.  If you wear a petticoat underneath you'll want to get a smooth one, not one with a lot of bumps as the bumps will show. The straps can either go over your shoulder like a cap sleeve or straight up like a tank.  If you don't pay attention and keep adjusting you'll end up with one sleeve type on one side and another sleeve type on the other side like in my picture, haha.  Overall, I like this dress a lot and it was flattering on my curvy figure."", 'I actually really love this dress. It did run slightly large, but not too large. I normally wear a size medium (or about a size 6-10, depending on the dress), I almost ordered a size large and I\'m glad that I didn\'t. The material is clearly a synthetic, and not too stretchy but also not completely stiff, but I really like the fabric, it\'s opaque enough to not be see-through while wearing it, though I do prefer to wear it with another A-line, swing skirt beneath it for a bit of extra volume, and a petticoat of proper length could look great beneath it as well! Though I would go for a slightly softer style petticoat, and I\'d make sure to figure out the right length for your petticoat for this dress after you see where your waist sits in the dress and can measure to see how long your petticoat will need to be.Now, I am short (5\'2""), with most of my length being in my torso rather than my legs, and the dress comes down to about the mid to lower section of my calf, and in my opinion looks lovely with my combat boots and stockings, and a cardigan or sweater or flannel. I can wear it both over and under my corsets, and it looks quite flattering to me both ways. It has a gorgeous swing to it, it just flows beautifully. It does zip up on the side, and the zipper is not obvious at all, and I do prefer the zipper on the side, as it makes it easier to zip than if the zipper were in the back. I\'m fairly busty (at least a D cup in most bras), and there was plenty of room for my bust, even in a vintage conacle style bra. I definitely recommend this dress.I will make an update later on my opinions regarding how it holds up to washes.', 'I ordered a large for a hostess in my wedding I decided to try it on ( I‚Äôm normally a 1x/2x) and it fits perfect.

I didn't have to pay a fortune yet still got a super detailed dress with quality fabric that made it look like I did.

Great product, good condition, fast shipping! If you found my review helpful, I would appreciate you clicking yes - thanks!!!', 'I originally ordered another dress, without fringe, by Babeyond (which cost $23). I changed my mind and decided I wanted one with fringe as it was for a Party Like Gatsby event. It was so much to fun to feel the fringe moving as I danced so I\'m really glad I ordered this dress, even though it was higher priced at $40. I read tons of reviews and decided to order this in size medium because I wanted a slightly looser fit. For reference, I\'m 5\'4"", 125 lbs and usually wear a size 4 or small. The first dress I ordered was also a medium and did fit slightly loose, so I thought this would be the same. Even though both dresses were by Babeyond, I would say this dress runs on the small side. Unfortunately, it was not loose, but instead fit just right. I have a slight stomach pooch and had to remember to ""suck it in"" so I think I would have been uncomfortable in a small. Although the inner slip is stretchy, the dress overlay is not and the slip is only attached to the bottom of the dress on the sides. There is a little give to the dress if you have a larger chest. The dress survived a night of dancing and activity very well. In lieu of a bra, I usually wear a camisole with a shelf bra. I wore the camisole with a pair of very short spandex shorts so I felt very comfortable under the dress. I did notice a loose thread when I took the dress off, but nothing broke off and otherwise it was fine. There is a side zipper and it slips easily over your head. The only ""issue"" might be going to the ladies room because of the fringe. Just be extra careful and check the back of the dress in the mirror as the fringe and slip can easily get caught up. The dress comes in a zippered bag so it can be easily stored. Also, this was a very popular dress. I saw multiple women in the same dress. FYI, I wore a pair of long black gloves, which really added to the look, but eventually took them off as I got tired of putting them on and taking then off because they were not cell phone friendly!', 'Love this dress! The numerous amount of sequins and beads makes this dress fabulous and fun to wear! I wore it to a 1920s party. I\'m 5\'2"" and about 125 lbs. I ordered a medium and a small. I kept the medium because I wanted a little more swing in the dress, ala flapper style. I did tack up the shoulder straps to reduce the slight underarm gap, and I also trimmed about 3.5 inches off the fringe to suit my petite height better...these modifications were pretty simple and actually improved the overall fit for my body type. The fringe was originally about 9.5 inches but the dress and slip underneath are pretty short...so because of my height, the length after trimming the fringe was perfect! The dress has some stretch, as others have mentioned, so it fits most body types well. A great dress and quite well-made for the price! No loss of sequins or fringe the whole evening. Would definitely recommend!!', 'I LOVE this red dress (the red really pops in photos even though on the hanger it looked more black than I expected).  I read a ton of reviews before buying because I couldn‚Äôt understand how it was so affordable. But it‚Äôs really nice and flattering. My friend got several dress options, another brand but somewhat similar dress, through  Amazon and felt they were all too baggy.  Got a ton of compliments.

Thankfully I was wearing it to a Harry Potter party and had robes on over it so it wasn\'t a big deal. I cannot stress this enough. It will expose you\'re ENTIRE butt. The fabric is cut at angles at the bottom and there\'s just a triangle missing where your but goes. I could see if there was a much larger size it might work for a larger girl, however as is right now if your skinny but have hips or a butt I would probably size up. Definitely designed for the stick ladies of the flapper era. The bead work and design are really beautiful and the beads by the armpit did not cut in and scratch up my skin there so it deserves 2 stars at least. I\'ve uploaded a picture of it on to sort of show where the dress hits at (sorry no back pictures), it seems longer than it is because of the fringe.', 'Bought this for a Halloween wedding reception.  Probably the funnest mother of the groom dress ever purchased!  The quality of this dress was simply amazing, especially considering the price.  I would highly recommend this to anyone for a formal costume party.  My only slight criticism is that it runs a bit small.  I bought the XL because I was wanting it to be roomy, but it was actually a little snug on me.  Had they offered an XXL, I would have returned for larger size, but they didn\'t offer XXL.  I\'m 5\'10"" and 172 pounds - I fit into the XL, but barely!  Despite being a little snug, I was still comfortable and the dress held up very well all night.

It hits a great note blending femininity and professionalism. For that purpose, 5 stars.EDIT: We bought two more in Merlot and UPS Brown (see additional photos). The Merlot is lovely. The Brown was her idea, and I can\'t say I\'ve warmed much to it, but the great style of the dress comes through anyway.Reviewing these photos, I think the look seems to recall a classic stewardess style. Also, the tie arrives loose, which allows for either a bow (shown with green dress) or knotted with loose ends (merlot and brown). I prefer the latter, because it breaks up the bustline.']","12,283",182

I am only 5\'5"" and figured I would need to hem it once I got it. Since I didn\'t want to take a chance with spilling out or showing too much for a work function I opted for the larger size. I ordered a 2X, and it puckered in the front and was slightly loose through the middle (no stretch). After taking the advise from a previous customer I cut the tacking threads at the chest. It looks great! I have a bit of pulling at the sleeves but not so much that it is noticeable, and not so much to where the shoulders don\'t align. I believe once I get a better bra to wear with it and the tutu petticoat slip I ordered it will look really good. I don\'t think I will need to hem it, but we will see once I have the petticoat. The material is very stretchy, therefore it is very forgiving. It will stretch another 3-4 inches for me so I may order a smaller one in a different color just to compare the look.

The fit was a little loose (I probably should have ordered an 18), but I was glad for the extra space in the waist and arms. I put a small stitch in the neckline, because the V neck opens wide and shows your bra if you bend over at all. That was an easy fix though, and the dress was a hit! Everyone complimented me on it and I was comfortable all night long! There is no lining in the skirt, so a slip is recommended underneath to add some additional comfort. It washes well (delicate cycle and hang to dry). I would recommend to anyone!', 'I freaking love this dress. It‚Äôs so flattering and the pockets are bae.', 'I love this dress.

I chose to wear shape wear with this dress but it is not a necessity.  I am 5‚Äô2‚Äù and this dress hits the floor with a few inches to spare with heels it is about floor length. I would say the dress runs a kiss small so order 1-2 sizes up depending on how you like your clothes to fit and your body type/shape. The dress is a little on the heavy end which gives it a nice flowy feel without it feeling like you‚Äôre going to have a Marylin Monroe moment. I would not expect this dress to withstand a washer well. So if you want to wear it multiple times be sure to keep it as clean as possible or wash on a hand washing cycle and air dry. The lace is delicate. Overall this dress is a bargain. I found dresses of similar style in the $200-500 range easily while this dress was right about $50 when I purchased it. I would recommend to anyone wanting a brides made dress, low budget or non traditionally colored wedding dress, prom, or any black tie affair.

It just looked and fit awkward with the under layer being scalloped at the top of the bust with the outer layer being a scoop neck. I am smaller busted so perhaps it would look better on a fuller bust. Overall I give it a 3 out of 5. Not fancy enough for a mother of the bride dress.

I also didn't need to use the back zipper as the dress had enough give to slip on over my head. It was a *little* tight around my chest, but I'm a 38DDD so that comes with the territory. It felt great everywhere else. It hit just below the knee and had a good amount of stretch to it. The quality of the fabric was excellent and the lace skirt was fun to twirl around in. The color was little bit of a brighter red than the photo shown in the listing, but still a lovely shade. All in all I was very happy with this dress!"", 'The best day of my life was in that dress', 'This dress is very flattering and comfortable. I am 5\' 4"", 135 lbs., and the size L is perfect for me. It hits just barely below my knees (I have short legs), which is just right for the semi-formal event I bought it for. it looks better with the belt, IMO. I can wear a pashmina with it for cooler weather.', 'I was a little scared to bought it, because the dress looks that have a zipper on the back, normally this type of dress running‚Äôs smaller, I decided to bought one more size just in case didn‚Äôt fits me. When my dress arrives and I tried it, was perfect ü§©. It‚Äôs stretchy, looks formal, I am not tall so the length is a little large but it‚Äôs ok for me because I don‚Äôt like to short. The color it‚Äôs perfect üëçüèº, if you think üí≠ about it don‚Äôt do it just bought it!', ""I bought this for a wedding guest dress and it seems perfect.  The fit is just right.  I'm 5'4 and the hem is just even with the knees. That's the length I was looking for. I'm glad the belt is removable because I didn't really want to use it.  The color is beautiful as well. I'm very happy with it.""]","3,012",46

Get out a tape-measure and measure yourself then refer to the sizing chart. Don't go by what you normally wear or try to size up or down seriously just measure yourself. I did and it fit perfectly. Now I'm just waiting for warmer weather so I can wear it!"", 'Omgosh. This dress is beautiful.  I really enjoy this kind the dress üíñüíñ', 'I needed a LAST minute costume for a decades party. I choose 1950s. Got this over nighted, love prime. Threw my hair in some victory rolls, put on the red 50s style dress, red pumps and the look was fantastic! Many people stopped me in the store before the party just to tell me how much they loved the dress. And ask me if it was a ever day thing I did.lol Would recommend. Only issue I had was the chest didn‚Äôt fit properly. Im an A36 on a good day. Lol so as to be expected honestly. Put two safety pins in, one on each side and it fit nice and snug. No other complaints. Material was comfortable as well. I‚Äôm 5‚Äô4 and 143 lbs. The dress came right to my knees and fit my waist very nice and flattered me. Worth the money.', ""This dress was amazing in my 50s inspired photoshoot. I have a small chest so I had to pin it on the sides, but it's still am awesome fit."", 'I purchase a large amount of vintage dresses from Amazon and absolutely love this style. It accentuates your tata‚Äôs like a dream. I love bright bold colors and mix matched prints and this certainly fit the bill. I am 5‚Äô2‚Äù and about 140 pounds. I do tend to carry my weight in my stomach area. I many times order a large, but elected to order a medium in this case because many of the dresses have a stretch to them and I wanted a snug fit. The beauty of amazon is you can return something to Kohl‚Äôs and get your money refunded to Amazon in just two hours to get the correct size!  Gotta love it. This was worn to a pinup car show contest that had a duration of about five hours. I was comfortable and received many compliments. Of course I added a bit of fluff with a petticoat. If it‚Äôs on your mind to buy this dress, I say do it!!!', 'I don\'t have a very large chest 32 -34"" bust,  so I had to take it in under the arm pits, and behind colar... so it would fit.  But lovely material.  Best part ...I asked if they could send it before my bday.... which was the 22, I got it 2 days before even though expected date was like 26 or something.  That made my day!! Would order from them again just because of the extra little customer service there, even if product didn\'t fit perfectly.  5 stars.']","1,401",15
MINTLIMIT Women's 1950s Retro Vintage Cocktail Party 3/4 Sleeve Swing Dress,39.99,Visit the MINTLIMIT Store,4 out of 5,"['Loved this dress. Zipper was a bit tricky at one specific point but it‚Äôs the type of zipper problem I‚Äôve seen on many dresses. It came nicely folded and fit great with a good amount of stretch to it. I am 5‚Äô5 170lbs and a medium fit well. Got a ton of compliments. It is a simple design so don‚Äôt expect a lot of built in support. Some dresses come with that extra layer of fabric on the inside. This one did not. But that isn‚Äôt a deal breaker for me but I know it is for some. This is my favorite fancy dress so far. Would order again 10/10.', 'This is an update to my other review. I ordered the first with white background in XL it was baggier around the shoulders and although online I thought it was a light pink background it was white, definitely white.  Still very pretty.I bought a petty coat to add fullness since this is for a southern wedding.I then ordered a more colorful dress in LG. See the brighter dress I posted. Well according to the sizing it really cut off a couple inches from the chest area and waist which made it very difficult to zip up.  It was tight and looked nice.Both beautiful and both recommended.Brighter pink was just too tight around chest i‚Äôm Probably a 35-36C, and when I sat down I got the bulges from my bra on back and sides etc. Which I didn‚Äôt like.So I‚Äôm going with the whiter one in XL. I am washing in cold and will iron areas on warm to bring it in a bit.Also bought off white cream fascinator and double strand of pearls from Amazon fulfillment.I could never find a dress this nice in a store for even close to this price.I am 5‚Äô8 1/4‚Äù tall. I can‚Äôt give my weight sorry it would be painful!You‚Äôre gonna love these dresses, the 3/4 sleep and cut make them so much fun. I want one in every pattern now.', 'The style is cute, it had been exactly what I was looking for. BUT . . . I have issues.The BIGGEST issue I have with this dress is the zipper. It‚Äôs AWEFUL. Even without it on, I STRUGGLE to get the dang thing up! So fighting with it while it‚Äôs ON . . . A nightmare.My second complaint is the material. I wash it with cold water and hang dry. Yet the black color started fading immediately. It‚Äôs dull and old looking after just a couple washes.The material is also a nightmare to steam. It just won‚Äôt get completely wrinkle-free. And it comes out of the wash SO wrinkled, so it‚Äôs such a chore.The stitching is already coming apart at the bottom of the zipper, so the whole zipper is starting to poke out of the bottom.I‚Äôve only had this dress a few weeks, wore it just a few times, and it looks years old already.', ""I was crossing my fingers that I bought the right size because getting the fit right on the bust is always a gamble. It fit perfect though and with the crinoline petticoat I have, it's a really cool dress! I got the XL and I'm 5'3 195lbs 38G bust. I usually wear a size 16/18 or XL/XXL depending on the dress bust line and arm circumference. I have plump upper arms and I still had a bit of room in the sleeve. The bust was exactly right, perfectly fitted not skin tight."", 'Love it! I\'m 5\'2"" (5\'3"" on a good day), 185 lbs, 40ddd. I ordered the XL, and it fit me perfectly. It\'s fitted (so tight-ish) on the boobs and arms, but not uncomrtably so, and I can definitely move just fine. It was looser around the waist, so it\'s not like it was pulling against my stomach or making me have to ridiculously suck it in or anything like that.  So again, very comfortable and VERY flattering. Overall, love it, and I\'m gonna buy a second one. Hope it fits you as well as it fits me!', 'I absolutely adore this dress. The print is stunning and the cut has a retro feel while still being very wearable. Perfect for fall and winter.', 'I wear the dresses to Church every Sunday. A Sunday hasn‚Äôt passed but someone would tell me ‚ÄúI love your dress‚Äù!', 'I love this dress, don‚Äôt forget to order a petticoat!']","1,395",14
